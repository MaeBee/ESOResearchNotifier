# ESOResearchNotifier
ESOReseachNotifier is a simple Windows tool to keep track of ongoing research in The Elder Scrolls Online. It does so by grabbing data from the custom plugin [ResearchDump](https://github.com/gobbo1008/ResearchDump).

## Requirements
* [The Elder Scrolls Online](https://elderscrollsonline.com) and its prerequisites
* [ResearchDump](https://github.com/gobbo1008/ResearchDump/releases/latest) (gets installed automatically)
* [.Net Framework 4.5.2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=42643) and its prerequisites

## Installation
1. Install The Elder Scrolls Online
2. Make sure .Net Framework 4.5.2 is installed
3. Download and unpack [ESOResearchNotifier](https://github.com/gobbo1008/ESOResearchNotifier/releases/latest) to a folder of your choice. The program will need read/write access to that folder. Then run ESOResearchNotifier, which will install the required addon.
4. Run ESO with the ResearchDump addon and log in to any accounts and characters you want to track
5. Select the characters you want to track in ESOResearchNotifier
